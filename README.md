People' Party of Music.

![PPOM EXAMPLE](https://github.com/jrans/PPOM/blob/master/techCrunchFinal2.gif)

## Inspiration
Started off as a Twitter jukebox app that morphed into Tinder for crowdsourcing music at parties!

## What it does
Users can create a party and distribute the party name. Party-goers can search for tracks from the humm API and make suggestions to the party playlist, as well as review suggestions from other users by swiping tinder-like cards right (like) or left (reject). Songs which get a certain number of swipe rights are added to the jukebox queue. When the jukebox is running low on suggestions, we plan to use humm's recommendation API to keep the party going!!

## How we built it
React-Native front end with a Node.js backend, Postgresql database and the Humm API.

## Challenges we ran into
Playing audio with React Native, XCode, Babel Updates,

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Figuring out how to convert YouTube videos into mp3 streaming binaries!
Playing audio with React Native
Staying awake all night!

## What we learned
Test Driven Development for the win!

## What's next for The People's Party Of Music

Build an audio streaming module for React Native
Add in humm's recommendation engine for song suggestions to top up music playlist.
Sell the service to restaurants, bars and clubs
